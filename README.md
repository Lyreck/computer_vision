# computer_vision ðŸ“º
Matlab code for a computer vision course I followed at Mines Nancy.

The "code" folder contains code for each class (1 class = 1 folder). 

For each class, a short report explains what I did.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the topics tackled in these codes:
- filtering
- image registration
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- feature extraction
- stereovision
- homographies for pose computation
- augmented reality (to be fair, I only drew a cube)
- snakes and contours.
